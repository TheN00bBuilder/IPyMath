# IPyMath
Easy IP and subnet mask math for Python.

To make this work, give it execute permissions with `chmod +x ipmath.py' . 

To read about how to use this little code, do `./ipmath.py -help` to read the few functions it has.


The correct way to call the methods is...
```
from ipmath import domath
domath("ip_string", True/False (for verbosity))
```
